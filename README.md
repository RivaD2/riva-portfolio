### My Portfolio

**While building out my portfolio, I solidified my skills in React, ES6, and CSS. Because my portfolio is space-themed, I decided to make requests to NASA's API for images using Axios**

**While building out this project, I familiarized myself with CSS Frameworks like Bootstrap, Semantic-UI and Materialize but I ultimately chose not to use these front-end frameworks and built the CSS out myself**

### ON THE FRONT-END

* React
* Semantic-UI 
  
### ON THE BACK-END

* Node.js
* NASA API's to access the NASA Image and Video Library for some of my photos
* Axios HTTP request library

### LANGUAGES USED

* CSS/CSS3 animations
* JavaScript
* ES6

**OTHER TOOLS**

- Gifski , MP4 to WEBM Converter

### HOW IT WORKS

- From the home page, click on the Projects button to be directed to the Projects Page
- On the Projects page, for every project listed the user can do the following:
    - **Click on the View Demo button**: This opens a modal and provides the user with a gif of me demoing a project. A  description of how the app works is provided as I move through it.
    - **Click on the Source Code Button**: The user will be redirected to the source code for each project on Github
      
- The sticky nav bar allows the user to easily jump to my resume, Github, LinkedIn profile and provides a link for them to contact me.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
