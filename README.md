### Hello there! Thank you for checking out my developer portfolio.

While building out my space-themed portfolio, I focused my efforts on solidifying my knowledge of React and incorporated the Nasa Image and Video Library API to aid in theming (I should note that there are no pictures of cats in my portfolio...although that might have made it better :)).

Most of the CSS is built out from scratch. However, I made use of Semantic-UI icons in my navigation bar and in the modal.


### Tools Used:

* React
* React-Router-DOM
* Semantic-UI 
* NASA Image and Video Library
* Axios
* AWS for deploying site

### LANGUAGES USED

* CSS/CSS3 animations
* JavaScript/ES6

**OTHER TOOLS**

-  mp4 to WebM Converter
-  TinyPNG

### HOW IT WORKS:

- To use, visit the deployed site at: [rivadavidowski.com](https://www.rivadavidowski.com/)
- You can also check it out by cloning the repo and running `npm i` via the command line. 
- From the landing page, click on the Projects button to be directed to the Projects Page.
- Use the navbar to visit my Github repo, LinkedIn profile, view my resume, or learn more about me via my about page.
- On the Projects page, falling arrow indicates that scroll down is needed. For every project listed the user can do the following:
    - **Click on the View Demo button**: This opens a modal and provides the user with a WebM of the project. A brief description of the project is provided along with my specific contributions.
    - **Click on the Source Code Button**: The user will be redirected to the source code for each project on Github.
    - **Click on the Deployed Version Button**: The user will be redirected to the deployed version of the project.
